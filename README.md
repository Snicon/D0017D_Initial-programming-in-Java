# D0017D (Fall 24) - [Initial programming in Java](https://www.ltu.se/en/education/course/d00/d0017d-initial-programming-in-java) @ [LTU](https://ltu.se/en)
This is my first university level programming course. I have previously studied C# (some java), PHP & Python at Realgymnasiet Norrköping and LBS Kreativa Gymnasiet Linköping.

This course was targeted as people that have never tried programming before and therefor taught the very basics of Java without any OOP. OOP was strictly forbidden and different marked assignments had different rules to uphold, all assignments required following a specified coding style. Some data structures were forbidden to use throughout the course and the assignments had different requirements, some could not be solved using methods or loops (looking at you assignment 1), and others had more freedom (assignment 3 and forward).


## Structure
The repo contains all the task sets, practice problems, practice assignments, marked assignments, practice exams and (soon) my final exam I've done through the course. These are all structured in folders (packages) based on the assignment/task/exam they are solving.


## About assignments

### Marked assignment 1 - Dice Game
A game where the player rolls 3 dice to get a totalsum of 12 in order to win.
The biggest challenge with this assignment was implementing it without using methods as these were forbidden for this part of the course.


### Marked assignment 2 - Random Numbers
A program that generates random numbers, separates them into even and odd, sorts them, and then displays the results with a summary.
The biggest challenge with this assignment was implementing it without using methods as these were forbidden for this part of the course as well as sorting.

### Marked assignment 3 - Mathematic Methods
A program that handles user input for calculating area and volume calculations, as well as fraction simplifications and printing.
The biggest challenge with this assignment was implementing the fraction simplification.

### Marked assignment 4 - Cash Register
A program that acts as a very basic cash register that temporarily stores data on sales and items(stock). This data can be sorted and outputted or added to by selecting an action. All data in handled in memory. For more detailed information of the program I encourage you to read the great many comments.
The biggest challenge of this assignment was extending, sorting and navigating the arrays.


## Progress & grades

### Assignments

| Assignment          | Handed in | Grade      | Best possible grade |
|---------------------|-----------|------------|---------------------|
| Marked Assignment 1 | &#9745;   | G#         | G#                  |
| Marked Assignment 2 | &#9745;   | G#         | G#                  |
| Marked Assignment 3 | &#9745;   | G#         | G#                  |
| Marked Assignment 4 | &#9745;   | G#         | G#                  |
| Final exam          | &#9744;   | -          | G#                  |

### Final grade
To be determined.


## Credits
While I've made almost all work all by myself there are two exceptions to this, PracticeAssignment1.java and PracticeAssignment2.java have been written in a pair-coding style via Jetbrains using Code With Me on a student license. This has been a great way of collaborating for non-graded work and improving my coding communication skills.
I especially thank Josef (globox610 on Discord), Felix (rageroll on Discord) and Michelle (michelle_88981 on Discord) for the amazing productive work as well as less productive fun chit-chats. You made this experience much more fun that it already was from the beginning! <3
